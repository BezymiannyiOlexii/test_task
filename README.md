# test_task
For work with this project you need to download image_clustering.py, load_data.py and dataset from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nKyb_JoJiSXuIUnBjjExo_X4YTw-KIRk?usp=sharing).
Your project structure should be like that:

|
|__load_data.py
|
|__image_clustering.py
|
|__caltech256.zip

You do need to unzip archive, the program do this by itself. For strart working - run image_clustering.py file.

Some requirements that I use in project:
tensorflow==2.7.0
python==3.9.9
sklearn==1.0.1
